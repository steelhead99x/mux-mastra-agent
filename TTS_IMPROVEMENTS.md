# Text-to-Speech Improvements for Mux Analytics Agent

## Overview
Enhanced the Mux Analytics Agent to always return the audio URL prominently and significantly improved the naturalness of the Deepgram TTS output.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Deepgram TTS Function (`synthesizeWithDeepgramTTS`)
**File**: `backend/src/agents/mux-analytics-agent.ts`

**Improvements**:
- Minimal text preprocessing - let Deepgram's AI handle natural pauses:
  - Between paragraphs (`\n\n` ‚Üí `. `) - converts to periods for natural flow
  - Single line breaks (`\n` ‚Üí ` `) - converts to spaces
  - Removed aggressive ellipsis additions that caused stuttering
- Upgraded audio quality settings:
  - Sample rate: 24kHz (high-quality audio)
  - Container: WAV (standard format)
  - Encoding: linear16 (PCM)
- Using Deepgram's Aura models for natural-sounding speech

**Deepgram Best Practices Applied**:
‚úÖ Minimal preprocessing - trust Deepgram's natural interpretation
‚úÖ High-quality sample rate (24kHz)
‚úÖ Proper audio format configuration
‚úÖ Smooth, non-stuttering speech output

### 2. Always Return Audio URL Prominently
**File**: `backend/src/agents/mux-analytics-agent.ts`

**Improvements**:
- Audio URL is now the **PRIMARY** output, displayed at the top with clear formatting:
  ```
  üéß **AUDIO REPORT READY**
  
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Listen to your analytics report: [URL]
  ```
- Added dedicated `audioUrl` field in the response object
- Implemented fallback mechanism using `assetId` if `playerUrl` isn't immediately available
- Always includes time range in the response message

**Response Structure**:
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  summaryText: string,
  wordCount: number,
  localAudioFile: string,
  playerUrl: string,      // Primary URL
  assetId: string,
  analysis: object,
  message: string,        // Prominently displays audio URL
  audioUrl: string        // Dedicated field for audio URL
}
```

### 3. Updated Agent Instructions
**File**: `backend/src/agents/mux-analytics-agent.ts`

**New Requirements**:
- ALWAYS include the audio playback URL prominently - it is the PRIMARY output
- Audio URL must be displayed at the top of responses in a clear, visible format
- Include both text analysis AND audio playback URL in every response
- Audio is generated using Deepgram TTS with natural pauses and conversational tone

### 4. Conversational Text Formatting
**File**: `backend/src/tools/mux-analytics.ts`

**Before** (Robotic, bullet-point style):
```
Mux Video Streaming Analytics Report
Time Range: 10/9/2025, 12:00:00 AM to 10/10/2025, 12:00:00 AM
Overall Health Score: 85 out of 100
Key Performance Indicators:
- Total Views: 1,234
- Average Startup Time: 2.50 seconds
- Rebuffering Rate: 3.20%
```

**After** (Natural, conversational style):
```
Hello! Here's your Mux Video Streaming Analytics Report.
This report covers the time period from October 9th, 2025 to October 10th, 2025.

Let's start with your overall health score... which is 85 out of 100.

Now, let me walk you through the key performance indicators.
First, you had a total of 1,234 views during this period.
Videos took an average of 2.5 seconds to start playing.
The rebuffering rate was 3.2 percent... which is within acceptable range.
```

**Key Conversational Improvements**:
- Friendly greeting: "Hello! Here's your report..."
- Natural transitions: "Let's start with...", "Now, let me walk you through..."
- Contextual feedback: "that's excellent!", "which needs attention"
- Human-like phrasing: "I need to be honest with you...", "Overall..."
- Proper closing: "That concludes your analytics report. Thank you for listening!"
- Changed from space-separated to newline-separated for better natural pauses

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Generate a test report**:
   ```bash
   # Ask the agent for analytics for the last 24 hours
   # Verify the audio URL is displayed prominently at the top
   ```

2. **Listen to the audio**:
   - Check for natural pauses and conversational tone
   - Verify no robotic reading of bullet points
   - Confirm proper pronunciation of numbers and dates

3. **Verify URL return**:
   - Ensure audio URL is always included in the response
   - Check that URL is clickable and prominently displayed
   - Verify fallback mechanism works if initial URL isn't ready

## Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Uses existing configuration:
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` - Required for TTS
- `DEEPGRAM_TTS_MODEL` or `DEEPGRAM_VOICE` - Optional (defaults to `aura-asteria-en`)
- `STREAMING_PORTFOLIO_BASE_URL` - Base URL for player links

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Audio reports sound natural and conversational
2. **Clearer Output**: Audio URL is impossible to miss
3. **Accessibility**: Easier to consume analytics through audio
4. **Professional Quality**: High-quality 24kHz audio output
5. **Natural Flow**: Pauses and pacing match human speech patterns

## Technical Details

**Deepgram TTS API Parameters**:
- Model: `aura-asteria-en` (high-quality Aura model)
- Encoding: `linear16` (PCM audio)
- Sample Rate: `24000` (24kHz - high quality)
- Container: `wav` (standard audio format)

**Text Preprocessing**:
- Paragraph breaks (`\n\n`) ‚Üí Periods (`. `) for natural pauses
- Single line breaks (`\n`) ‚Üí Spaces for smooth flow
- Minimal intervention - let Deepgram handle natural pacing

## Files Modified

1. `backend/src/agents/mux-analytics-agent.ts` - TTS function, response formatting, agent instructions
2. `backend/src/tools/mux-analytics.ts` - Conversational text formatting

No breaking changes. All existing functionality preserved.
