# TTS Audio and Text Synchronization Fix

## Problem

When users requested error reports, they noticed a **mismatch between the TTS audio content and the agent's text response**:

- **TTS Audio:** Contains the actual synthesized error analysis
- **Agent Text Response:** Agent was creating its own separate analysis that didn't match the audio

### Example Issue:

**User asked:** "Analyze errors for last 7 days"

**What happened:**
1. Tool generated TTS audio with specific error breakdown
2. Agent received the audio URL and errorData
3. Agent **created its own text summary** from errorData that was different from the audio
4. User got confused: "Why does the text not reflect what's in the audio?"

## Root Cause

In the agent's system prompt (`mux-analytics-agent.ts` line 934):
```
'- Include both text analysis AND the audio playback URL in every response'
```

This instruction caused the agent to:
1. ‚úÖ Generate TTS audio with `summaryText`
2. ‚ùå Then add a **separate** text analysis that didn't match the audio
3. ‚ùå User sees two different versions of the same data

## Solution

Updated the agent's `RESPONSE FORMAT` instructions to be explicit:

### Old Instructions (Problematic):
```javascript
'- Include both text analysis AND the audio playback URL in every response',
```

### New Instructions (Fixed):
```javascript
'RESPONSE FORMAT (CRITICAL - FOLLOW EXACTLY):',
'- Display format: "üéß Audio Report URL: https://www.streamingportfolio.com/player?assetId=..." at the TOP',
'- The audio URL must be displayed first in a clear, visible format',
'- AFTER showing the audio URL, include the "summaryText" field from the tool response',
'- The summaryText contains EXACTLY what is spoken in the audio - show this to the user so they know what the audio says',
'- DO NOT create your own separate analysis - the analysis is already in the summaryText/audio',
'- Your text response should MATCH what is in the audio file',
'- Format: Show audio URL, then show the summaryText verbatim, then offer to answer questions',
```

## How It Works Now

### 1. TTS Tool Generates Audio
```javascript
// In ttsAnalyticsReportTool
summaryText = `Error Analysis Report for Paramount Plus Streaming:

Time Period: October 3, 2024 to October 10, 2024

Total Errors Detected: 36

Error Summary:
Your streaming platform encountered 36 errors during this period...`;

// Generate TTS audio from summaryText
const audioBuffer = await synthesizeWithDeepgramTTS(summaryText);

// Return response with summaryText field
return {
    success: true,
    summaryText,        // ‚Üê This is what's in the audio!
    playerUrl: finalPlayerUrl,
    audioUrl: finalPlayerUrl,
    errorData: {...}
};
```

### 2. Agent Displays Matching Text
```javascript
// Agent now shows:
1. Audio URL: "üéß Audio Report URL: https://..."
2. The summaryText verbatim (what's actually spoken)
3. Offer to answer follow-up questions

// Agent does NOT create a separate analysis
```

## Expected Behavior

### User Request:
```
"Summarize my errors over the last 7 days"
```

### Agent Response Should Be:
```
üéß Audio Report URL: https://www.streamingportfolio.com/player?assetId=abc123...

Error Analysis Report for Paramount Plus Streaming:

Time Period: October 3, 2024 to October 10, 2024

Total Errors Detected: 36

Error Summary:
Your streaming platform encountered 36 errors during this period.

Error Breakdown by Platform:
1. macOS: 35 errors (0.5% error rate)

Top Error Types:
1. Invalid Playback ID: 35 occurrences - The URL or playback-id was invalid
2. Retry Attempt: 1 occurrence - Retrying in 5 seconds...

Recommendations:
1. Investigate the most common error types to identify root causes
2. Focus on platforms with the highest error rates
3. Review player configuration and encoding settings
4. Monitor error trends over time to catch regressions early

## Key Changes

### File Modified:
- `backend/src/agents/mux-analytics-agent.ts`
- Lines: 916-943 (updated system prompt)

### What Changed:
1. ‚úÖ Added explicit `RESPONSE FORMAT` section to system prompt
2. ‚úÖ Instructed agent to display `summaryText` field verbatim
3. ‚úÖ Prohibited agent from creating separate analysis
4. ‚úÖ Clarified that text must MATCH audio content
5. ‚úÖ Specified exact format: Audio URL ‚Üí summaryText ‚Üí Offer help

## Benefits

1. **Consistency:** Text and audio now match exactly
2. **User Trust:** Users know what they'll hear before playing the audio
3. **Accessibility:** Text version available for those who can't/don't want to listen
4. **Searchability:** Full text content is visible and searchable in chat history
5. **Clarity:** No confusion about which analysis to trust

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

```bash
# 1. Start the backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# 2. In a separate terminal, ask the agent:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3520/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Summarize my errors over the last 7 days"}'

# 3. Check that:
# - Audio URL is displayed
# - The summaryText matches what's in the audio
# - Agent doesn't add separate analysis
```
