# Mastra Agents Initialization Fix

## Issue Summary

The Mastra framework was not properly initializing agents when passed to the constructor, resulting in `mastra.agents` being undefined or empty. This caused 500 errors in the Express API endpoints when attempting to access agents.

### Error Symptoms

- **500 Internal Server Error** with message: `"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'mux-analytics')"`
- API endpoint `/api/agents` returned an empty agents array `[]`
- Agent streaming endpoints failed with "Agent not found" errors

## Root Cause

The `Mastra` constructor accepts an `agents` configuration object, but in some cases (likely due to framework internals or version compatibility), it doesn't properly initialize the `agents` property on the instance. This left `mastra.agents` as `undefined` even though valid agents were passed to the constructor.

## Solution

Added a workaround that manually assigns the agents configuration to the Mastra instance if they weren't initialized by the constructor:

```typescript
// Create agents configuration
const agentsConfig = { 
  'mux-analytics': muxAnalyticsAgent,
  'media-vault': mediaVaultAgent,
};

const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: agentsConfig,
}) as any; // Type cast: Mastra's type definition doesn't expose agents property

// Workaround: Mastra constructor doesn't properly initialize agents in some cases
// This ensures agents are always available for the Express server
if (!mastra.agents || Object.keys(mastra.agents).length === 0) {
  console.warn('[Mastra] Agents not initialized by constructor, adding manually...');
  mastra.agents = agentsConfig;
}

console.log('[Mastra] Agents loaded:', Object.keys(mastra.agents || {}).join(', '));
```

## Type Safety

The Mastra type definition doesn't expose the `agents` property in its public API, causing TypeScript errors. We use a type cast `as any` on the Mastra instance to work around this limitation while maintaining runtime functionality.

## Testing

After applying this fix:

1. ✅ `/api/agents` endpoint returns: `["mux-analytics", "media-vault"]`
2. ✅ Agent streaming endpoint successfully processes requests
3. ✅ Frontend chat interface works without 500 errors
4. ✅ Analytics queries complete successfully with audio report generation
