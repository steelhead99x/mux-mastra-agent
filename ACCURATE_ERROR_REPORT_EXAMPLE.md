## Key Insights & Recommendations

### üî¥ Priority 1: Invalid Playback ID (41 errors - 82%)

**Actionable Steps:**
1. **Audit your video assets** - Check which playback IDs are being used
2. **Review URL generation** - Ensure playback IDs are being constructed correctly
3. **Check for expired or deleted assets** - Verify all referenced assets still exist
4. **Validate signed URL generation** - If using signed playback policies, verify token generation

### üü° Priority 2: Network Issues (3 errors - 6%)
**Problem:** Some users experiencing network-related download failures.

**Actionable Steps:**
